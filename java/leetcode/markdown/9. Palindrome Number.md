# 9. Palindrome Number

# Description

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

# Examples

- Example 1:

  <br/> Input: x = 121 <br/>
  Output: true
  <br/> Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.


- Example 2:

  <br/> Input: x = -121 <br/>
  Output: false
  <br/> Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.


- Example 3:

  <br/> Input: x = 10 <br/>
  Output: false
  <br/> Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.


# Constraints

- -2<sup>31</sup> <= x <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
